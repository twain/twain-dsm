    * dsm.cpp Create a local copy of the AppID that is passed to DS for processing.
      Fix the problem that the reallocate to the list of Application may causes the
      pointer to the AppID passed to be corrupt before OpenDS finishes.  This only 
      happens when the DSM recieves multiple OpenDSM messages in the same process space.
      If this happens, messages sent from DS to App will get lost.
