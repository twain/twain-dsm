/*
* [Overview]
*   The contents of this module allow the new TWAINDSM.DLL (tied to the 2.x version
*   of the TWAIN Specifiction) to hook functions that might try to access the 1.x
*   TWAIN_32.DLL.  We need this because the DG_CONTROL/DAT_NULL/MSG_* triplets are
*   sent from the data source (driver) to the application through the data source
*   manager (DSM).  The technique used was for a driver to issue a LoadLibrary or
*   a GetModuleHandle, which would result in it attaching to the same TWAIN_32.DLL
*   first loaded by the application.  We have to force the driver to attach to the
*   new TWAINDSM.DLL instead.
*
*
* [Diagram]
*   This is the problem we have...
*   +-----+           +--------------+           +--------------+
*   | app | <-------> | TWAINDSM.DLL | --------> |              |
*   +-----+           +--------------+           |              |
*                                                | driver (1.x) |
*                     +--------------+           |              |
*        error <----- | TWAIN_32.DLL | <-------- |              |
*                     +--------------+           +--------------+
*
*   By hooking the appropriate function, we change the driver's request to get
*   the DSM_Entry function from TWAIN_32.DLL into the DSM_Entry function from
*   DSM_ TWAINDSM.DLL
*   +-----+           +--------------+           +--------------+
*   | app | <-------> | TWAINDSM.DLL | <-------> |              |
*   +-----+           +--------------+           |              |
*                                                | driver (1.x) |
*                     +--------------+           |              |
*                     | TWAIN_32.DLL |           |              |
*                     +--------------+           +--------------+
*
*   Note that TWAIN_32.DLL is still in the picture.  This is intentional,
*   because we're (indirectly) hooking GetProcAddress.  The driver still
*   does a LoadLibrary or GetModuleHandle on TWAIN_32.DLL.  This design
*   was selected because it results in the smallest possible hook code,
*   and makes the smallest possible change to the 1.x driver.  Everything
*   runs the same as a TWAIN_32.DLL session, we just return a pointer to
*   a different DSM_Entry function.
*
*
* [Hooked Functions]
*   This is the ntdll.dll function we're hooking from kernel32.dll...
*     LdrGetProcedureAddress (or LdrGetProcedureAddressForCaller)
*   This gives us full coverage for the following function...
*     GetProcAddress
*
*
* [Solution]
*    The hook code is derived from the BugSlayer HookImportedFunctionByName function
*    described in the August 1998 MSJ.  The code has been considerably simplified to
*    meet the limited needs of the DSM.
*
*
* [Risks]
*    32-bit Windows applications using TWAINDSM.DLL will never be able to access
*    the TWAIN_32.DLL DSM_Entry function.  Since this is by design, it's not so
*    much a risk as "the plan", but it still deserves to be mentioned.
*
*    We're not fully loading the TWAIN_32.DLL, because we don't have control over
*    it, and we can't be sure what it's doing in DllMain.  This could be a problem
*    with a very badly behaved application.  The scenerio is so convoluted, though,
*    that it seems a good risk to keep TWAIN_32.DLL as uninvolved as possible.
*
*    The application will crash if it does a FreeLibrary() on the DSM without first
*    doing all the necessary MSG_CLOSEDS and MSG_CLOSEDSM calls.  This can be
*    mitigated by hooking LdrUnloadDll() and watching for an attempt to unload the
*    DSM.  But this adds complexity that rewards extremely bad coding behavior, so
*    it's not going to be added unless we have a lot of bad actors we have to deal
*    with.
*
*    Hooks should be avoided whenever possible.  Therefore the DSM code only installs
*    the hook if the application attempts to DG_CONTROL/DAT_IDENTITY/MSG_OPENDS a 1.x
*    driver on a 32-bit Windows system.
*
*    This system is only designed to work with Window 2000 and higher, there is no
*    intention of supporting either Windows NT or any of the Windows 9x platforms.
*    Nor is there a reason to, since they don't have a file protection scheme (save for
*    WinME, but hopefully nobody is still using that)...
